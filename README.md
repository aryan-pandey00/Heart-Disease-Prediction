# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques on clinical patient data.  
A Logistic Regression model is used to provide probability-based predictions for decision support.

## Dataset
- Heart Disease Dataset (CSV)
- 303 records with 14 clinical features
- Target: `0` = No Heart Disease, `1` = Heart Disease

## Model
- Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

## Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
